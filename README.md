## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
Working with the addEventListener method was very fun, and proved challenging at times.  I particularly struggled a bit with the password reveal exercise and using get/set for the attribute "type".  I initially was just trying to grab the type without placing a get/set, which yielding a timeout response during testing.  Fun exercises overall!
